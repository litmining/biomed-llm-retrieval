    "summary": "Based on the provided JSON file containing metadata from various neuro-meta-analyses, here is a summary of the most common inclusion and exclusion criteria across the studies:\n\n### Common Inclusion Criteria:\n1. **Language and Publication Type**:\n   - Studies must be published in English and in peer-reviewed journals.\n   - Original research articles are preferred; reviews, meta-analyses, and case studies are generally excluded.\n\n2. **Participant Characteristics**:\n   - Studies often include adult participants, with some specifying age ranges (e.g., 18-60 years).\n   - Participants may have specific conditions (e.g., diagnosed with mental health disorders like MDD, schizophrenia, or anxiety), while healthy controls are often included for comparison.\n   - Some studies allow for inclusion of children or adolescents, particularly in developmental or cognitive studies.\n\n3. **Methodological Criteria**:\n   - Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) is common, with a preference for whole-brain analyses rather than region-of-interest (ROI) analyses.\n   - Studies must report peak coordinates in standard stereotactic space (e.g., MNI or Talairach).\n   - Some studies require specific diagnostic criteria (e.g., DSM or ICD) for conditions like PTSD or depression.\n\n4. **Study Design**:\n   - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are frequently included, particularly in treatment studies.\n   - Studies examining specific cognitive or emotional tasks, such as working memory, emotion regulation, or decision-making, are common.\n\n5. **Outcome Measures**:\n   - Studies that report on specific neuroimaging metrics (e.g., ALFF, ReHo, functional connectivity) and their relationship to psychological constructs or behaviors.\n\n### Common Exclusion Criteria:\n1. **Study Type**:\n   - Exclusion of review articles, meta-analyses, case studies, and conference abstracts.\n   - Non-original research or studies lacking full-text availability.\n\n2. **Participant Conditions**:\n   - Studies that include participants with comorbid conditions (e.g., other psychiatric disorders) are often excluded.\n   - Studies involving children or adolescents may be excluded unless specified.\n\n3. **Methodological Limitations**:\n   - Studies that do not report coordinates in standard stereotactic space, or that only use ROI analyses.\n   - Non-fMRI or non-PET studies are generally excluded.\n\n4. **Data Quality**:\n   - Studies with insufficient sample sizes (often less than 10 participants) or those reporting null findings without usable coordinates.\n   - Studies that do not adequately correct for multiple comparisons in their statistical analyses.\n\n5. **Specific Conditions**:\n   - Studies that focus solely on certain types of stimuli or tasks that do not meet the criteria (e.g., tasks not related to the targeted cognitive or emotional processes).\n\n### Summary\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria across the studies emphasize the importance of methodological rigor, appropriate participant selection, and the relevance of cognitive and emotional constructs being investigated. There is a clear preference for studies that utilize neuroimaging techniques to assess specific psychological phenomena, while excluding studies that do not meet these standards or that involve confounding variables."
