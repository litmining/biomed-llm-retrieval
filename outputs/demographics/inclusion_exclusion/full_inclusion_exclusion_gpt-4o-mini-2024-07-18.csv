All of the participants with TS were diagnosed based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Tic severity was assessed based on direct child and parent interview using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). The CPRS-R was used to assess ADHD symptoms using continuous, standardized age and gender adjusted CPRS-t scores.

The scale contains 27 items and is composed of 4 subscales including: Cognitive Problems/Inattention, Hyperactivity, Oppositional and the ADHD Index. A major advantage of the CPRS-R is that it uses a very large normative database (8,000+ children) to support the validity and reliability of it.

He was not religious, had no comorbidities, and had an older brother who had schizophrenia. The onset of his symptoms was at age 20, and he had a history of multiple admissions (more than 10 times) due to symptom recurrence, resulting in progression of cognitive impairment and treatment-resistance even for positive symptoms. Although he had no specific fear or anxiety, he experienced schizophrenia-related general fear and anxiety. During hospitalisation, he underwent modified electroconvulsive therapy and received various antipsychotic drugs (including depot injections). Despite this, his symptoms fluctuated. However, his social skills remained relatively good and he could plan and manage his daily life after discharge. During this unstable clinical course, we noticed that he sometimes performed seiza on his bed when he met medical personnel such as doctors. Occasionally, he performed dogeza as well as seiza when he asked for something, such as cigarettes and drugs. Although the request itself was reasonable, considering the situation, these postures seemed inappropriate, bizarre, and stereotyped. More importantly, he performed these postures and deep bowing during periods of symptom deterioration, i.e., when his symptoms were unstable. On being asked the reason for the postures, he answered that he felt sorry for the doctor and did not provide any further details and that he performed dogeza to indicate an entreaty rather than an apology. While he denied any association with hallucination or delusion, he accepted an association with fear, tension, and anxiety, implying that these postures were signs of symptom deterioration. At the time of discharge, he was being treated with 150 mg paliperidone palmitate and maintenance modified electroconvulsive therapy. His scores on the positive, negative and general subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) improved from 30, 28, and 60 on admission to 15, 27, and 35 at the time of discharge, respectively.","Our other patient was a 46-year-old woman with schizophrenia diagnosed based on the DSM-5.

The onset of her symptoms was at age 36, and she had a history of four admissions due to severe psychosis including auditory verbal hallucinations, such as I will kill you and I hope you die, delusions of reference, guilt, and pregnancy, and moderate negative symptoms. During initial hospitalisation, she frequently performed dogeza in the corridor and at the bedside. On being asked the reason for this, she answered that she needed to apologise because her auditory hallucinations led her to being accused of breaking things and stealing money (these were clearly her delusions), for which she felt guilty. Furthermore, she showed a posture of harakiri (suicide by cutting one's stomach to express apology) and asked medical personnel to kill her. During one admission when AK was in charge of her treatment, she was administered clozapine (up to 375 mg) and her symptoms gradually improved. Dogeza frequency decreased with symptom improvement until it finally disappeared.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) obtained from embryos at 14 days post-coitum were prepared and treated with mitomycin-C (10 g/mL) to control MEF overpopulation. EB were cultured on day-10 with transduction medium to determine the cardiac-specific expression of the NCX1 promoter. To confirm the construction of an overexpressing NCX1 promoter iPSC cell line, iPSC (2.510 ) were assayed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 57 days after transduction. The sorted GFP  cells were plated into a 96-well plate pre-plated with MEF. Then, the single iPSC colonies were expanded into colonial cell lines and were tested individually for firefly luciferase (Fluc) activity during cardiac differentiation. Clones that showed stable Fluc activity were selected for further characterization and   in vivo   studies. To assure CM enrichment, continuous puromycin (1.5 g/ml) conditions were used to reduce non-CM formation.","Purification of specific cell lineages derived from iPSC is vitally important for prevention of teratoma formation. We used several steps to avoid teratoma formation. First, lentiviral vectors containing specific cardiac promoters guide differentiation of progenitor cells exclusively into CM and these vectors also expressed both GFP and puromycin resistance (Puro ). GFP was used as a marker for further purification of CM and their precursors by FACS. Continuous selection of CM in puromycin (1.5 g/ml) enriched media was used to further reduce potential contamination by non-CM. These methods proved most effective, eliminating teratoma formation during the 4 weeks of this study.",False,Embedded in Materials and Methods section
