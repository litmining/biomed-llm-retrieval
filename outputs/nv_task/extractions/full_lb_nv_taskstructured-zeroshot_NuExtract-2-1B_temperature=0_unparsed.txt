Participants were first presented with an implicit task while undergoing fMRI and eyetracking, followed by the explicit task which involved emotion identification and eyetracking. An implicit task was undertaken during fMRI as explicit tasks have a higher cognitive demand and more frontal areas involvement, making it more difficult to observe activity in areas involved in emotion processing ( ;  ). In the implicit task, participants were presented with each stimulus twice in a pseudorandom fashion, resulting in a total of 16 presentations of each emotion over two runs. In the explicit task, participants were shown each stimulus once, resulting in eight presentations per emotion over one run. Due to the extended length of the task in the MRI, participants were not presented with surprised faces in the implicit task as it is the most ambiguous emotion, having neither a positive nor negative emotional valence.
