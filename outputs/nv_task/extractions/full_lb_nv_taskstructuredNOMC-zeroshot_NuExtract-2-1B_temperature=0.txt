When examining whole-brain activity during synchronization, activations were observed in the IFG and IPL (related to the AO system) as well as in the dmPFC (related to the gap-monitoring system). These findings, which are based on measuring brain activity during a naturalistic and interactive interpersonal synchronization, further strengthen the notion that motor interpersonal synchronization does not involve only sensorimotor components, but that indeed additional neural networks are recruited. Specifically, our study provides support for the existence of the gap-monitoring system, which assists in obtaining synchronization.", "NeuroimagingAnalysis": {"WholeBrainAnalysis": "Whole-brain analysis comparing activity patterns during the entire condition duration and free movement condition during the total run duration, across loneliness groups.", "Analysis": "Mixed-design ANOVA with following score as the dependent variable, with loneliness groups as the between-subject factor, and loneliness groups as the within-subject factor.", "Results": "Significant clusters in the right IPL (54, −42, 48), the left IPL (−56, −46, 40), the right IFG, opercular part (38, 10, 24), and the right dmPFC (6, 36, 34); see  ."}, "Discussion": "Comparing high and low loneliness groups in regions of interest activity during following periods, high loneliness was related to increased neural activity in the IPL and the IFG. This suggests that high loneliness individuals need to activate their AO system more when they are asked to synchronize their movement, compared to low loneliness individuals. These hyperactivations may be related to social impairment in loneliness. Moreover, despite previous accounts of lonely people reporting lower enjoyment from social interaction, and in contrast to our hypothesis, in our study, there were no significant differences in the zero-lag correlation score between the high and low loneliness groups. This may speak against the involvement of the reward system in movement synchronization, but it is also possible that longer periods of optimal alignment are required to stimulate the reward system.
