In the explicit task, participants were shown each stimulus once, resulting in eight presentations per emotion over one run. Due to the extended length of the task in the MRI, participants were not presented with surprised faces in the implicit task as it is the most ambiguous emotion, having neither a positive nor negative emotional valence. Participants were also pseudorandomly presented with a black-and-white image of their own face with a neutral expression, with 16 presentations during the implicit task and eight during the explicit task. Photographs of participants were taken by the researcher while participants were instructed to look straight ahead with a relaxed expression, similarly to a passport photograph. Participants’ own face photographs were edited to match the properties of the Ekman face stimuli in terms of size and resolution, and were made black-and-white.", "Conditions": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Healthy control"], "TaskMetrics": ["BOLD signal variance", "Feature fixation index (FFI)", "Feature duration index (FDI)"], "RestingState": "true", "TaskDesign": ["Other"], "TaskDuration": "8000 ms"}], "BehavioralTasks": [{"TaskName": "fMRI-CBF", "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented
