{"Modality": ["fMRI-BOLD"], "StudyObjective": "Characterize sex differences in cerebral responses to reward anticipation and feedback and whether women and men differ in the influences of individual reward and punishment sensitivity on these neural processes.", "Exclude": null, "fMRITasks": [{"TaskName": "Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT)", "TaskDescription": "Participants pressed a button to collect reward ($1, 1Â¢, or nil), with the reaction time window titrated across trials so participants achieved a success rate of approximately 67%.", "DesignDetails": "The task involved a bet that appeared on the screen at the beginning of each trial. After a randomized fore-period between 1 and 5 seconds, a target box was shown for a short period (response window). Subjects were told to press a button as quickly as possible to collect the money (win) before the target box disappeared. An accurate trial was defined by a button press before disappearance of the target box. Otherwise, subjects would lose the bet, with the amount deducted from the total win. Feedback was shown on the screen after each trial to indicate the amount of money won or lost. Approximately 42% of all trials were dollar trials, 42% were cent trials, and \"no money\" constituted the remaining trials. The inter-trial-interval was 1.5 seconds. The response window started at 300 milliseconds, and was staircased for each trial type (dollar/cent/no money) separately; for instance, if the subject succeeded at two successive dollar trials, the window decreased by 30 milliseconds, making it more difficult to win again; conversely, if a subject failed for two successive trials, the response window increased by 30 milliseconds, making it easier to win.", "Conditions": ["Dollar", "Cent", "No Money"], "TaskMetrics": ["Accuracy rate", "Reaction time"], "RestingState": false, "TaskDesign": ["Other"], "TaskDuration": "10 minutes"}], "BehavioralTasks": []}
