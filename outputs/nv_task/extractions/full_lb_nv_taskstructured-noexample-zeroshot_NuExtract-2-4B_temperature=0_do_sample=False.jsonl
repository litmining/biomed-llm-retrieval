The BART measures participants\u2019 willingness to engage in risky behavior in order to earn rewards, and is associated with real-life risk taking in adolescents and adults. During the scan session, participants were presented with a sequence of 24 balloons that they could pump up to earn points. Each pump decision was associated with earning one point but also increased the risk that a balloon would explode. If participants pumped a balloon too many times, the balloon would explode and participants would lose all the points they had earned for that balloon. However, if participants chose to cash out before the balloon exploded, the points they earned would be added to the running total of points, which was presented on the screen as a points meter. Participants were instructed that their goal was to earn as many points as possible during the task.

Participants were told that they could win a $10 gift card at the end of the neuroimaging session if they earned enough points during the task.

Specifically, we were interested in how adolescents used feedback information from previous trials in order to guide their current behavior, and to adapt that behavior when it results in maladaptive outcomes. Previous research using the BART has shown that adolescence is a time of increased feedback learning (compared with childhood), and that individual differences in feedback learning predict differences in risk behavior.

This paradigm is optimized for mapping multiple contrasts using a mixed design, using auditory (environmental/vocal) and visual (scene/face) stimuli. We demonstrate that the paradigm evokes robust neuronal activity in typical sensory and memory networks. We were able to detect auditory and visual sensory-specific encoding activities in auditory and visual cortices. Also, we detected stimulus-selective activation in environmental-, voice-, scene-, and face-selective brain regions (parahippocampal place and fusiform face area). A subsequent recognition task allowed the detection of sensory-specific encoding success activity (ESA) in both auditory and visual cortices, as well as sensory-unspecific positive ESA in the hippocampus. Further, sensory-unspecific negative ESA was observed in the precuneus. Among others, the parallel mixed design enabled sustained and transient activity comparison in contrast to rest blocks. Sustained and transient activations showed great overlap in most sensory brain regions, whereas several regions, typically associated with the default-mode network, showed transient rather than sustained deactivation. We also show that the use of a parallel mixed model had relatively little influence on positive or negative ESA. Together, these results demonstrate a feasible, versatile, and brief memory-encoding task, which includes multiple sensory stimuli to guarantee a comprehensive measurement. This task is especially suitable for large-scale clinical or population studies, which aim to test task-evoked sensory-specific and sensory-unspecific memory-encoding performance as well as broad sensory activity across the life span within a very limited time frame.", "DesignDetails": "The task was designed as a mixed model (Visscher et al.,  ) and included 180 events (trials), grouped into 32 blocks ( ). Out of these 32 blocks, eight were rest blocks (fixation), eight isolated auditory blocks, eight isolated visual blocks, and eight parallel auditory/visual blocks. Sixteen blocks contained auditory stimuli, half isolated auditory and half parallel with visual images. Of these 16 blocks, eight blocks contained environmental sounds (four isolated and four parallel), and eight blocks contained vocal sounds (four isolated and four parallel). Similarly, for the visual blocks, half were presented in isolation and half in parallel with sounds (scene and face images equally distributed). In each block, five items\u2014sounds, images, or both\u2014were presented for a total of 16 s per block ( ). Within the auditory blocks, the inter-trial interval between items was 200\u20132,700 ms. Within the visual stimulus blocks, the inter-trial interval between items was 200\u20132,200 ms. The difference in the inter-trial intervals between auditory and visual blocks is due to the variable duration of sounds. Each image was presented for exactly 2,000 ms. Inter-trial intervals as well as the order of blocks and the order of stimuli within the blocks were once randomly assigned and remained the same for all participants. A white fixation cross on black background was shown during the rest blocks, the inter-trial intervals, the isolated auditory blocks, and the initial and final 8 s of each run. By design, we tried to ensure that the different blocks and items would result in separate, uncorrelated regressors (see section Parallel Mixed Model Analysis).

Trials were structured as follows: First, an arrow (2000\u00a0ms) indicated the   target   (self vs. other) of the upcoming stimulus. The intensity of the upcoming stimulus was indicated by the color of this arrow (red: painful vs. green: nonpainful). After a jittered blank screen (3500\u2009\u00b1\u20091500\u00a0ms), the electrical stimulus (500\u00a0ms) was delivered during simultaneous presentation of another visual delivery stimulus (1000\u00a0ms). The latter consisted of a picture of the confederate\u2019s face, shown with either a painful or a neutral expression, or, in case of self-directed stimulation, scrambled versions of these pictures were shown to control for visual stimulation.

In the second run (empathy for affective touch) a confederate acting as a second participant was supposedly undergoing affective touch, and participants were instructed to empathize with her feelings. In every single self-directed trial, visual presentation of an object was accompanied by simultaneous stroking of the left palm at 1\u00a0Hz for 2\u00a0s in proximal-to-distal direction with a material whose touch resembled the touch of the object depicted on the screen. For example, touching the participant\u2019s hand with down feathers was accompanied by the picture of a chick to elicit a pleasant affective touch experience. The stimuli had been selected in extensive pretesting based on maximum agreement among participants in terms of congruency between visual and somatosensory stimulus and emotional responses (see   for paradigm validation test). In one third of the trials (5 per condition), participants were asked to rate the stimulation in that trial on a 9-point scale ranging from very unpleasant (left extreme of the scale) to very pleasant (right extreme) for either themselves or, supposedly, for the other participant (i.e., the confederate).
