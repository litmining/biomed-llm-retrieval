Furthermore, we tested a proposed neural model for interpersonal synchronization and explored the neural activation related to synchronization in high and low loneliness individuals. Using a novel computerized fMRI paradigm, we were able to measure neural activity during naturalistic, live interaction of participating dyads. Our initial hypothesis regarding the following periods was confirmed, as the high loneliness group showed a lower level of ability to synchronize, which was reflected by their lower following scores in the sync condition. This observation supports previous findings with regard to the social impairments of lonely individuals and sheds additional light on the underlying mechanisms that may inhibit positive social interaction for lonely individuals. If lonely individuals have difficulties in aligning themselves with others, they will most likely miss out on the social benefits of synchronization such as increased connection, engagement, satisfaction, liking, and affiliation ( ), which in turn may result in their more negative reports of their interactions. The neuroimaging findings support the model proposed for interpersonal synchrony ( ). When examining whole-brain activity during synchronization, activations were observed in the IFG and IPL (related to the AO system) as well as in the dmPFC (related to the gap-monitoring system). These findings, which are based on measuring brain activity during a naturalistic and interactive interpersonal synchronization, further strengthen the notion that motor interpersonal synchronization does not involve only sensorimotor components, but that indeed additional neural networks are recruited. Specifically, our study provides support for the existence of the gap-monitoring system, which assists in obtaining synchronization. However, when examining high and low loneliness individuals engaged in active synchronization using the measurement of following periods, high loneliness was related to increased neural activity in the IPL and the IFG. This suggests that high loneliness individuals need to activate their AO system more when they are asked to synchronize their movement, compared to low loneliness individuals. These hyperactivations may be related to social impairment in loneliness. Recently, it was suggested that the AO system contributes not only to motor alignment but also to emotional and cognitive alignment ( ). While this study focused only on motor alignment, these findings could potentially extend to other types of social interaction as well, a notion that should be explored in future studies. Similarly, previous studies have shown that lonely people have a reduction in fractional atrophy of white matter tracts linked to the IFG ( ) as well as decreased white matter density in the IPL ( ), which may further reduce the effectiveness of the AO system. No differences were found in the dmPFC activity between high and low loneliness individuals. This may speak against the involvement of the reward system in movement synchronization, but it is also possible that longer periods of optimal alignment are required to stimulate the reward system. In addition, there is recent evidence that multiband sequences have lower power to detect reward-associated striatal activation ( ).", "DataAvailability": "The behavioral data of the current study as well as the beta values extracted from the regions of interest are openly available in https://github.com/SANSlabHaifa/Alone_again.
