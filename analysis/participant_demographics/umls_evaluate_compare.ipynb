    "# Evaluate UMLS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Summary: Evaluating UMLS Code Extraction Accuracy**  \n",
    "This notebook evaluates the accuracy of extracting Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) codes for patient diagnoses reported in biomedical research papers. The core process involves comparing UMLS codes generated by automated methods against manually annotated reference codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:**  \n",
    "   * We started with a dataset (combined\\_pd.csv) containing annotations of participant demographics extracted from research papers. This dataset includes manually assigned UMLS codes (umls column) corresponding to the reported patient diagnoses. Some entries also contain umls\\_posthoc codes, which were added after the initial annotation to refine or correct the ground truth.  \n",
    "   * The data was filtered to include only entries pertaining to 'patients' and where a UMLS annotation exists. Key fields like PMCID, diagnosis text, and annotated UMLS codes were retained.  \n",
    "2. **Loading Automated Predictions:**  \n",
    "   * We loaded multiple sets of automated UMLS code predictions. These predictions were generated previously by applying the scispacy library's UMLS extractor to diagnosis strings.  \n",
    "   * These diagnosis strings themselves were originally extracted using various methods, differing by:  \n",
    "     * **Text Source:** Markdown (md) or HTML (html) conversion of the original paper.  \n",
    "     * **Processing:** Full text (chunk=False) vs. chunked text (chunk=True) processing during the initial demographic extraction phase.  \n",
    "     * **Model:** Different large language models (e.g., gpt-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18).  \n",
    "     * **Prompt:** Different prompting strategies used for the initial demographic extraction (e.g., demographics-zeroshot, demographics-fewshot, demographics-zeroshot-ftstrict).  \n",
    "   * Metadata describing the specific method used for each prediction set (source, chunking, model, prompt) was extracted from the filenames and stored.  \n",
    "3. **Matching Predictions to Annotations:**  \n",
    "   * For each prediction set, we matched the predicted UMLS codes (umls\\_cui) against the manually annotated reference codes (umls and umls\\_posthoc) for each paper (identified by pmcid).  \n",
    "   * The matching process worked as follows for each paper:  \n",
    "     * It iterated through each *annotated* diagnosis group.  \n",
    "     * It attempted to find a *predicted* UMLS code that matched the *annotated* umls code(s).  \n",
    "     * If no match was found, it attempted to find a match against the *annotated* umls\\_posthoc code(s).  \n",
    "     * Crucially, matching was done **without replacement** within each paper: once a predicted group (identified by group\\_ix) was matched to an annotated group, it could not be matched to another annotated group in the same paper. This ensures a one-to-one mapping where possible.  \n",
    "     * If multiple predicted codes matched a single annotation, the one with the highest confidence score (umls\\_prob) was chosen.  \n",
    "     * The outcome (match found \\= 1, no match \\= 0), whether the match involved a post-hoc code, the probability of the match, and the predicted diagnosis text were recorded. \n",
    "     * NOTE: `umls_posthoc` was added because often upon manual review it was clear that the prediction was correct, but did not match an existing annotation, so I added it afterward as a correct option. \n",
    "4. **Accuracy Calculation and Analysis:**  \n",
    "   * Results from all prediction sets were combined.  \n",
    "   * An \"a priori\" match metric was calculated, counting only matches to the original umls codes (excluding post-hoc matches).  \n",
    "   * Summary statistics (total matches, mean accuracy) were calculated for both overall matches and a priori matches, grouped by the different extraction methods (source, chunking, model, prompt).  \n",
    "   * The results were analyzed to compare the performance of different methods, examining overall accuracy, failure rates, and specific examples of mismatches and discrepancies between methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to determine which combination of text source, processing strategy, model, and prompt resulted in the most accurate automated UMLS code extraction when compared to manual annotations.  "
